# hyperskill_regex_engine
The program that imitates the work of re module (regular expressions). In the very simple mode.

The input should be:

\.$|end.
3\+3|3+3=6
\?|Is this working?

We are looking for matches in any place of the string, not only in the beginning of it, like it's done in re module.
